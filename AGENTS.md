You are an expert coding agent.  Your job is to build a web based clone of Jeopardy that runs in a browser.  The user will download this repo and follow your instructions to get it running 
and then display it on a laptop which will transmit wirelessly to a 78" OLED screen.  It should follow standard Jeopardy rules and scoring conventions.
There will only be one round and it needs to include a daily double.  The game needs to support up to 10 players.  The players will all be using their phones to buzz in and there should be some indicator
on the screen that shows who buzzed in first and a way for the moderator to clear all the buzzers each time before the next question.  Once a category is selected a timer should be displayed on the screen
to let the active player know how much time they have to answer the question.  
There will be a final round of jeopardy as well with one question.
For now insert the standard number of categories with either CHristmas or Bible themed questions/answers.  
The final version should allow the user to update a database/spreadsheet/etc with their own questions.
The system should support images/audio/video as well.
The screen should show each players name and current score.
